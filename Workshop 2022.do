	label drop V02_01 // droping the label attached to variable value. Often not in use. 
	
	
	**How to label the value of variables.
	label define V02_01 0 "NO" 1 "YES"
	label value v02_01 V02_01
	
	**Creating the dewelling ownership variable
	gen dewelling_ownership=1 if v02_01==1       //it will assign the value 1 in dewelling_ownership (new variable created) if variable v02_01 takes the value 1. 
												//For other attached value in v02_01 (2 in this example)  it generate missing.
	replace dewelling_ownership=0 if v02_01==2 //now assinging the value 0 to dewelling_ownership when  v02_01 takes the value 2.
	
	*****Another way to create same variable. Note- drop dewelling_ownership first before executing the below command as we cannt have same variable name twice in STATA.
	
	gen dewelling_ownership =v02_01==1  // dewelling_ownership takes the value 1 if v02_01 takes the value 1 otherwis takes the value zero. i.e. variable v02_01 takes
										// value zero if v02_01 is other than 1 including missing value (.,.a)
	
	****Creating same variable using recode. Note:-drop before executing as before
	recode v02_01 (1=1) (2=0), gen(dewelling_ownership)
	
	***Another way to create same variable using inlist*****
	 gen dewelling_ownership = 1 if inlist(v02_01,1)
	replace dewelling_ownership = 0 if inlist(v02_01,2)
	
	*Note that they have their own advantages and disadvantages. You will learn as you keep on using it over time. 
	
	***Example  in practice*****
	
	***Creating categories of Age*****

replace age_cat =2 if v01_03>5 & v01_03<=30		 // assign value 2 to variable age_cat if v01_03 (i.e. age) variable is on the range 6 to 30.
replace age_cat=3 if v01_03>30 & v01_03<=60		// similar
replace age_cat=4 if v01_03 >60					// assing value 4 to variable age_cat if v01_03 (i.e. age) is greater than 60 (including missing) 
								
						*Note:- Missing (.) is treated as largest number in STATA
						*To ignore the missing in last command you have to write command as (adding & v01_03!=.)
						*replace age_cat=4 if v01_03 >60	&	v01_03!=.
						* v01_03!=. means variable v01_03 not equal to miss.
						*you can use ~ insteat of ! also.'

 tab age_cat
 
 *** Labeling new variable age_cat,*****
 
 *** It is two step process.
	** First define the label
	** Second attache the define label with variabe.	
label define ac 1 "age 0-5" 2 "age 6-30" 3 "age 31-60" 4 "age 60 plus"  
label value age_cat ac // ac is label name we defined

*or
*** using recode*****

								*Note '*' mean other values including missing, you can use '61/max' to ignore missing
									* pre(R) uses 'R' as first letter to create new variable. It generate new variable Rv01_03(combining 'R' and v01_03 (variabe name under use))
									*pre(R) is alternative to gen.
									*label(abc) is defining label name as 'abc' like 'ac' first step before.

***Normally one command line is written in same line. If we write same command line in two or three line using 'Enter' it wont execute.

***Two write same command in different line for asthetic propose and for easyness. 
*You can do it in two ways. using 'delimit' or '///'
